# Space Runner

## What is space runner?
Space Runner is a 3D JavaScript runner game that uses WebGL with the help of a library (Three.js) and HTML/CSS for styling. A runner game is simply a game that has a character continously moving in a certain direction while avoidiing obstacles.

## Why We Chose This Project
We wanted to recreate a few runner games that we are familiar with. Space Runner is inspired by: Chrome Dino, Subway Surfers, and Temple Run.

## Results from Inspiration
To add our own spin to the concept, we created a space themed runner game that follows a metal, rolling sphere (the character) that dodges obstacles. The obstacles are asteroids placed randomly about the rocky path the sphere rolls on.

## Key Features of the Game
We managed to implement all features of the game with Three.js. Some of the features include:
  * 360 camera that circles around the character/sphere.
  * Character control to move the character left, to the middle, and to the right. The character is also capable of jumping.
	** Obstacles that the character must avoid to continue playing.
	** Sun light source that projects light on the environment and all objects within it.
	** Textures are added to the sun, path, and sphere for a more visually appealing experience.
	** Score system that increases the user's points by 10 every 600 milliseconds. Also keeps up with the high score.

## Controls
Use the A key to move the character to the left. 
Use the S key to move the charcater to the middle.
Use the D key to move to the character the right.
Use the W key to make the character jump.
Use the left and right keys to move the camera around the character.
Use the V key to toggle the camera back to the initial positon (which is behind the character)
